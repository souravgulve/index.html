Flipkart’s foundation in India was laid in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, both alumni of IIT Delhi and former employees of Amazon. The duo initiated their venture from a modest two-bedroom apartment in Koramangala, Bangalore. 
 
Fueled by their vision to revolutionize online retail, the initial investment of INR 2 lakh from each founder’s family set the stage for what would become a transformative journey.

Starting as an online bookstore with a nationwide shipping approach, Flipkart strategically focused on the sale of books. The company gradually gained prominence, processing 100 orders per day by 2008. This early success laid the groundwork for Flipkart’s expansion beyond books into diverse product categories.
